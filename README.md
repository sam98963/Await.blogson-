# Await.blogson() - Week 5 recap task.
A front end only application that allows users to comment on a blogpost. It takes their initials from the name input and places them within a circle indicating who commented. If no name is entered, the name Anonymous Author is asigned.

### Screenshots

### Motivation
This was a task assigned to us to consolidate all the info learned within the first week of learning React. I wanted the styling to be slick, minimal and uninvasive. This app is not responsive to changes in screen sizes.

### Lessons Learned
- How to initiale an app in react.
- How to render components onto a page.
- Writing functions using string methods to manipulate user input to a desired outcome.

### Tech Stack
- React
- Javascript
- CSS

### Improvements
If I had more time, I would make this app responsive, tie in a backend, or write to local files and allow comments to be stored over multiple renders. However, since it was more of a learning and consolidation tool, I will not be further elaborating on the app.
